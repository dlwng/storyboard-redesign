# Redesign Project for Storyboard 

In a team of two, we worked to redesign the [Storyboard program page](hackcville.com/storyboard/) for HackCville. HackCville is a talent-accelerator in Charlottesville, VA that works to provide students and community members with the skills to hustle and start something. Storyboard is HackCville's digital storyteller program -- teaching students the technical and soft skills needed for media production. The project included a significant design process that helped us to better understand the client but also create solid mockups before we launched into development.
