          Fill out an application
          <p><br>Each program has their own initial Typeform application that you can fill out. The application will ask basic questions like what year and major you are, but also longer questions such as "why you're interested" and "why you're a good fit" to get a better idea of who you are.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
          HackCville staff members review each app
          <p><br>After you submit your application, it is reviewed by current HackCville staff members, all students, with the exception of Daniel and Chip, HackCville's two full-time staff members. Staff members blind themselves to all names, emails, and demographic information to minimize any bias. Three staff members will read each application.<br><br><a href="http://thepioneer.co/2017/02/02/behind-the-scenes-of-hackcvilles-application-process/" class="apply-page-link">For a more in depth look at the review process â–º</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
          Called back for an interview
          <p><br>After staff members score and rank the applications, the top applicants are invited back to interview with two HackCville members. These two members will score the interview and compare them to the application scores in order to make a final decision.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
          Final Decisions
          <p><br>If you are accepted, CONGRATS! HackCville will notify you a few days after your interview. If not, don't worry! Applications are available every semester and there are other ways to be involved in the HackCville community. All events and startup trips open to the public are posted on our website at <a href="http://hackcville.com/" class="apply-page-link">hackcville.com</a>. We look forward to seeing you around our clubhouse!</p>
